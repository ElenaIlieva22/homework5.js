1. User Account Management:
Given an array of user objects, each containing a username and age property, 
create a new array containing only the usernames of users who are above 18 years old. 
Then sort the usernames alphabetically.
Input:
    const users = [
        { username: "charlie", age: 17 },
        { username: "bob", age: 30 },
        { username: "diana", age: 20 }
        { username: "alice", age: 25 },
    ];
Expected output:
    ["alice", "bob", "diana"]

/*
2. Message Filtering:
   Given an array of message objects, each containing a sender, recipient, 
   and message property, filter out all messages sent by a particular user (sender). 
   Then, concatenate all the remaining messages into a single string.
Input:
    const messages = [
        { sender: "alice", recipient: "bob", message: "Hello!" },
        { sender: "bob", recipient: "alice", message: "Hi there!" },
        { sender: "bob", recipient: "alice", message: "How are you?" },

3. Product Pricing:
    Given an array of product objects, each containing a name, price, and quantity property, 
    filter out products that are out of stock (quantity is 0) . 
    Then, calculate the total cost of all products (price * quantity)
    and sort the remaining products by total cost in ascending order.
Input: 
    const products = [
        { name: "apple", price: 1.5, quantity: 10 },
        { name: "banana", price: 0.75, quantity: 5 },
        { name: "orange", price: 2, quantity: 0 }

4. Employee Salary Calculation:
   Given an array of employee objects, each containing a name, salary, and department 
   property, calculate the total salary of all employees in a specific department. 
   Then, filter out departments whose salary is below a certain threshold, 50000, 
   and sort the remaining departments by total salary in descending order.
Input:
    const employees = [
        { name: "Alice", salary: 50000, department: "HR" },

5. Event Attendance Tracking:
    Given an array of event attendance objects, each containing an event, attendees, 
    and date property, filter out all events that had less than 60 attendees (filter out small events).

/*
6. Task Management:
    Given an array of task objects, each containing 
    a title, priority, and completed property, filter out all completed tasks.
